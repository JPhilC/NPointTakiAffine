# NPointTakiAffine
A C# implementation of the EQMOD NPoint_Taki_Affine demo code originally written by Raymund Sarmiento in 2006.

This is a C# project and solution converted from the VB6 code available in the EQMOD GroupsIO files section.

https://groups.io/g/EQMOD/files/Documentation/Developers/Design%20Proposals/Npoint_TAKI_AFFINE_2Star_1Star.zip

I have done the conversion as part of an exercise to understand the logic used in EQASCOM for star alignment.

The code from the original zip file has been augmented with updated code from the EQMOD code base.
